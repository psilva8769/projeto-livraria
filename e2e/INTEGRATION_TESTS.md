# Frontend Integration Tests Implementation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the integration tests implemented for the bookstore e-commerce application frontend.

## Tests Implemented

We have implemented two main integration tests using Cypress:

### 1. Product Search Integration Test

**File:** `cypress/e2e/product-search-integration.cy.js`

**Description:** Tests the search and filtering functionality in the shop page.

**Test Cases:**
- **should filter products by search input**: Verifies that the product search functionality works correctly:
  - Tests searching for a generic term that should return results
  - Tests searching for a non-existent term to verify "no results" message appears
  - Verifies the grid display updates appropriately based on search terms

- **should sort products by price**: Tests the product sorting functionality:
  - Verifies that products can be sorted by price (both low to high and high to low)
  - Confirms that the product grid is properly displayed after sorting

### 2. Contact Form Integration Test

**File:** `cypress/e2e/contact-form-integration.cy.js`

**Description:** Tests the contact form submission and validation functionality.

**Test Cases:**
- **should submit contact form with valid data**: Verifies that:
  - The form accepts valid input data
  - The form submission is processed correctly
  - The form is reset after successful submission

- **should validate required fields in form**: Tests the form validation:
  - Verifies that empty form submission is prevented
  - Tests partial form completion (missing different required fields)
  - Ensures proper validation behavior for each required field

## Running the Tests

To run these integration tests:

```bash
# Navigate to the e2e directory
cd e2e

# Run all integration tests
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/contact-form-integration.cy.js,cypress/e2e/product-search-integration.cy.js"

# Run a specific test
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/product-search-integration.cy.js"
```

## Test Coverage

These integration tests provide coverage for two critical user flows in the application:

1. **Product Search and Filtering**: Essential e-commerce functionality that allows users to find products
2. **Contact Form Submission**: Important user interaction for customer support and feedback

## Notes

- These tests are designed to work in conjunction with the existing unit tests
- Both tests use realistic user interactions (clicking, typing) to simulate actual user behavior
- The tests are written to be resilient to minor UI changes by using flexible selectors
