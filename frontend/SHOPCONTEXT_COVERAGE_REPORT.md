# Test Coverage Improvement Report

## ShopContext Component Test Coverage

### Current Status
- Test coverage: 85.29% of statements
- Test coverage: 65% of branches
- Test coverage: 88.88% of functions
- Test coverage: 85.07% of lines

### Successfully Testing:
1. ✅ Component is defined
2. ✅ Context object is valid
3. ✅ Initializes with default values
4. ✅ addToCart increments existing items
5. ✅ getCartCount returns correct total count
6. ✅ getCartAmount returns correct total amount
7. ✅ Handles API errors gracefully in getProductsData
8. ✅ Handles API errors gracefully in updateQuantity
9. ✅ Handles API errors gracefully in addToCart

### Failing Tests:
1. ❌ Fetches books on mount (URL issue)
2. ❌ Retrieves token from localStorage on mount (URL issue)
3. ❌ addToCart updates cart items and calls API with token (URL issue)
4. ❌ getCartAmount handles missing book info gracefully (Test design issue)
5. ❌ updateQuantity updates cart items and calls API with token (URL issue)

### Lines Not Covered:
- Line 51: In the addToCart function, not all branches covered
- Line 97, 107-114: In the getUserCart function
- Line 121-122: In the useEffect hook

### Remaining Issues:
1. The main issue is with mocking the `import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL` value, which causes the URL to appear as "undefined/api/..." in API calls.
2. The getCartAmount test for missing book info needs to be redesigned to properly set up an empty books array.

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the URL mocking issue in the test environment
2. Update the getCartAmount test to correctly test the missing book info scenario
3. Rerun all tests to achieve >90% coverage

## Overall Progress
We have substantially improved the test coverage for ShopContext.jsx, from having failing tests to having 9 passing tests and achieving over 85% line coverage. The remaining failing tests are primarily due to technical issues with the test environment rather than actual functional problems with the code.

## Recommendations
1. Consider creating a wrapper component for testing that explicitly sets the backend URL
2. Update the mock implementation to better handle the URL injection
3. Complete fixing the remaining tests to achieve >90% coverage
